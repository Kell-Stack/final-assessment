## Usage

Section-1

Ideally to see a list of Techtonica apprentices and all cohorts. At time of submission was only able to get all apprentices and add/delete first and last names of apprentices however route connections were a little off so the changes werent saved in the db. I believe with some tweaking this would work with a few changes but I'm not comfortable enough with React to have got it completly running during the assessment period.
