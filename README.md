## Reflection

Section-1 => React

Ideally to see a list of Techtonica apprentices and all cohorts. At time of submission was only able to get all apprentices and add/delete first and last names of apprentices however route connections were a little off so the changes werent saved in the db. I believe with some tweaking this would work with a few changes but I'm not comfortable enough with React to have got it completly running during the assessment period.

Section-2 => Code Challenges

I tried my best to explain the ideal way to solve each of the challenges. Syntactically, my code was terrible but hopefully the theory is somewhat there. It's very apparent that I have a long way to go and have to continuing taking longer than some to completly grasp concepts but metrics are a great way to evaluate what I need to spend more time on.
